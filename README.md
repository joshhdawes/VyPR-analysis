# VyPRAnalysis

A self-contained analysis library to use with VyPRServer at http://github.com/pyvypr/VyPRServer.

The general idea is to point at a verdict server using `set_server("http://")` and then use the functions provided by the library to query verdict data.

http://github.com/VyPRTutorial gives a (currently under-development) Jupyter notebook-style tutorial.
